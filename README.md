# timerSync
desktop and mobile timer sync

## Mission

Basically I am going to be creating a android and desktop applications, to sync via the net for timers.

_Case1_: during breaks at work - to have my countdown timers sync across the net on both phone and desktop.

_Case2_: to allow groups/teams sync time(rs)
